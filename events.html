<h1>FAREWELL</h1>
<h2>Every year we give a farewell party to all the class 12th students which is mostly organised by the students of class <br>
11th and funded by the school.It is a very huge event with a dance shows and other entertainment programs. After all the <br>
programs take place there is refreshments and students get to spend time with there friends . After this meetup between the<br> 
students our chairman sir addresses us. After this everyone enjoys the dinner and henceforth,the event is over.<br>
The dresscode is normally formal coat-suit for boys and saries for girls.<br>
The event takes place in the evening.<br><br>

"BUT THIS YEAR DUE TO THE COVID-19 SITUATION WE HAVE POSTPONED THE EVENT TO BE HELD AFTER THE BOARD EXAMS."
