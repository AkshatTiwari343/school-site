<h3>Sunbeam was founded in 1972 by Dr.Amrit lal 'Ishrat' Madhok and Mrs. Deesh 'Ishrat' Madhok, who felt the need of a private educational <br>
institution to cater to the holistic educational needs of the students fraternity in Varanasi and thus was born Sunbeam. Sunbeam started its <br>
momentous journey in a small rented apartment. Armed with a vision plus boundless energy and gaining credibility by the day, giant strides were <br>
 made and the young institution grew rapidly in enrolment, quality and community recognition and soon outgrew its place of birth and it became <br>
obvious that a new location was needed.<br></h3>

<p>After Sunbeam Bhagwanpur came Sunbeam Schools at Annapurna (1996), Sunbeam Womenâ€™s College (2000), Lahartara (2002),Varuna (2002), Indiranagar<br>
(2005)and Suncity (2010). The progressive march to spread education also resulted in opening up of Associate Sunbeam Schools at Mughalsarai (2004) <br>
Jaunpur, Allahabad, Ghazipur and Mau (all in 2011) and Deoria, Bhadohi and Narayanpur (2012) with many more on the anvil. Today more than 16000 <br>
studentsare part of Sunbeam Schools which over the years have given to the society, citizens par excellence and continue to contribute to the society through <br>
innumerable CBSE board toppers, national and international players of repute and stars who are shining bright in the cultural horizon.<br>
<br>
 
As a group, Sunbeam truly epitomizes the fact that success is a journey and not a destination.</p>

<h3>This statement is a universally acknowledged truth. It assumes greater importance in the 2Ist century where the whole world is shaping into a knowledge
world. So a school must aim at empowering its students with knowledge which enables them to compete in the present competitive world.

During recent times there has been unprecedented explosion of information. Such explosion in all the fields has made it compulsory that
we keep pace with the changes taking place. The school must promote proper understanding of concepts, problem solving techniques and art
of critical thinking.

STS aims at developing fully the mental, physical and spiritual potential of each child. From the portals of STS, turn out well-balanced
integrated personalities with an amalgamation of east and west. Ample opportunities and stimuli are provided for the physical, mental and
spiritual growth.

Our students are taught to aim always "Towards Greater Heights". This helps them to excel in life.
